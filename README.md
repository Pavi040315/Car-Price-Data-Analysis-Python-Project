# Car Price Data Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of car prices to identify key factors influencing vehicle valuation. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization of trends and correlations. The entire process is documented within a Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project is located in the `car_prices.zip` archive. Please unzip this file to access the raw data before running the notebook.

## Analysis

The core of this project is the `Data_Cleaning_and_Analysis.ipynb` notebook. This file contains all the Python code for:

*   **Loading and Inspecting Data:** Reading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
*   **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, correcting data types, and preparing the data for analysis.
*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Generating descriptive statistics and creating visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights within the data.

## Tools and Libraries

*   Python
*   Jupyter Notebook
*   Pandas
*   NumPy
*   Matplotlib
*   Seaborn
